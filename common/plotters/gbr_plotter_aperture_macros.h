// A aperture macro to define a rounded rect pad shape
// In many gerber readers, the rotation of the full shape is broken
// so we are using primitives that does not need a rotation around aperture origin.
// Note also the primitive 1 (circle) can use 4 or 5 parameters
// the 5th parameter is the rotation (not used by Kicad ) around aperture origin and is
// a recent optional parameter and can create compatibility issues with old
// Gerber viewer, so it is not output (default = 0).
