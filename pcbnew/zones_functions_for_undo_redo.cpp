/* These functions are relative to undo redo function, when zones are involved.
 *
 * When a zone outline is modified (or created) this zone, or others zones on the same layer
 * and with the same netcode can change or can be deleted due to the fact overlapping zones are
 * merged.  Also, when a zone outline is modified by adding a cutout area, this zone can be
 * converted to more than one area, if the outline is break to 2 or more outlines and therefore
 * new zones are created
 *
 * Due to the complexity of potential changes, and the fact there are only few zones in a board,
 * and a zone has only few segments outlines, the more easy way to undo redo changes is to make
 * a copy of all zones that can be changed and see after zone editing or creation what zones that
 * are really modified, and ones they are modified (changes, deletion or addition)

 *
 * aAuxiliaryList is a list of pickers updated by zone algorithms:
 *  This list contains zones which were added or deleted during the zones combine process
 * aPickList :is a list of zones that can be modified (changed or deleted, or not modified)
 *  Typically, this is the list of existing zones on the layer of the edited zone,
 *  before any change.
 *  >> if the picked zone is not changed, it is removed from list
 *  >> if the picked zone was deleted (i.e. not found in board list), the picker is modified:
 *          its status becomes DELETED
 *          the aAuxiliaryList corresponding picker is removed (if not found : set an error)
 *  >> if the picked zone was flagged as NEWITEM, and was after deleted ,
 *  perhaps combined with another zone  (i.e. not found in board list):
 *          the picker is removed
 *          the zone itself if really deleted
 *          the aAuxiliaryList corresponding picker is removed (if not found : set an error)
 * After aPickList is cleaned, the aAuxiliaryList is read
 *  All pickers flagged NEWITEM are moved to aPickList
 * (the corresponding zones are zone that were created by the zone normalize and combine process,
 * mainly when adding cutout areas, or creating self intersecting contours)
 *  All pickers flagged DELETED are removed, and the corresponding zones actually deleted
 * (the corresponding zones are new zone that were created by the zone normalize process,
 * when creating self intersecting contours, and after combined with an existing zone.
 * At the end of the update process the aAuxiliaryList must be void,
 *  because all pickers created by the combine process
 *  must have been removed (removed for new and deleted zones, or moved in aPickList.)
 * If not an error is set.
