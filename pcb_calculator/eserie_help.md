E-series are defined in IEC 60063.

Available values are approximately equally spaced in a logarithmic scale.

	E24(5%):  1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.5 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.7 3.0 3.3 3.6 3.9 4.3 4.7 5.1 5.6 6.2 6.8 7.5 8.2 9.1
	E12(10%): 1.0 1.2 1.5 1.8 2.2 2.7 3.3 3.9 4.7 5.6 6.8 8.2
	E6(20%):  1.0  -  1.5  -  2.2  -  3.3  -  4.7  -  6.8  -
	E3(50%):  1.0  -   -   -  2.2  -   -   -  4.7  -   -   -
	E1     :  1.0  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -

- This calculator finds combinations of standard E-series (between 10Ω and 1MΩ) to create arbitrary values.
- You can enter the required resistance from 0.0025 to 4000 kΩ.
- Solutions using up to 4 components are given.

The requested value is always excluded from the solution set.<br>
Optionally up to two additional values can be excluded in case of component availability problems.

Solutions are given in the following formats:

	R1 + R2 +...+ Rn	resistors in series
	R1 | R2 |...| Rn	resistors in parallel
	R1 + (R2|R3)...		any combination of the above
