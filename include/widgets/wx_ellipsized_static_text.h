/**
 * A version of a wxStaticText control that will request a smaller size than the full string.
 *
 * This can be used with the ellipsization styles to ensure that the control will actually ellipsize
 * properly inside sizer elements (since they ask for the best size but GTK reports the best size
 * as being the full string length, even when ellipsization is enabled). This work around is discussed
 * in upstream ticket https://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/18992.
