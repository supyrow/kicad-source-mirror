     * Open a project or set of files given by @a aFileList.
     *
     * This is generalized in the direction of worst case.  In a typical case @a aFileList
     * will only hold a single file, like "myboard.kicad_pcb" because any #KIWAY_PLAYER
     * is only in one #KIWAY and the #KIWAY owns the #PROJECT.  Therefore opening files
     * from multiple projects into the same #KIWAY_PLAYER is precluded.
     *
     * Each derived class should handle this in a way specific to its needs.  No filename
     * prompting is done inside here for any file or project.  There should be no need to
     * call this with \a aFileList which is empty.  However, calling it with a single
     * filename which does not exist should indicate to the implementer that a new session
     * is being started and that the given name is the desired name for the data file at
     * time of save.
     *
     * This function does not support "appending".  Use a different function for that.  Any
     * prior project data tree should be cleared before loading the new stuff.  Therefore,
     * one of the first things an implementation should do is test for existence of the first
     * file in the list, and if it does not exist, treat it as a new session, possibly with
     * a UI notification to that effect.
     *
     * After loading the window should update its Title as part of this operation.  If the
     * #KIWAY_PLAYER needs to, it can load the *.pro file as part of this operation.
     *
     * If the KIWAY_PLAYER cannot load any of the file(s) in the list, then it should say
     * why through some GUI interface, and return false.
     *
     * @param aFileList includes files that this frame should open according to the knowledge
     *                  in the derived wxFrame.  In almost every case, the list will have only
     *                  a single file in it.
     * @param aCtl is a set of bit flags ORed together from the set of KICTL_* \#defined above.
     * @return true if all requested files were opened OK, else false.
